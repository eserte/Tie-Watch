			   Tie::Watch version 0.95

	An object oriented interface to the Perl builtin tie(), that allows a
watchpoint to be placed on any Perl variable.  A watchpoint is simply a
callback (subroutine) that is invoked when a variable is accessed.

	The callback can do various things:

 . alter a variable's value
 . prevent a variable's value from being changed
 . invoke a Perl/Tk callback when a variable changes
 . trace references to a variable

Do:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install
