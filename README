				  Tie::Watch

	An object oriented interface to the Perl builtin tie(), that allows
a watchpoint to be placed on any Perl variable.  A watchpoint is simply a
callback (subroutine) that is invoked when a variable is accessed.

	The callback can do various things:

 . alter a variable's value
 . prevent a variable's value from being changed
 . invoke a Perl/Tk callback when a variable changes
 . trace references to a variable

Do:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install

You may find the programs in the .../examples directory interesting.

This version supports tied arrays and REQUIRES Perl 5.004_57 or
higher.  Also, the old Delete() method has been renamed Unwatch()
since it conflicted with the builtin delete() function.

BUGS:  not aware of any.
